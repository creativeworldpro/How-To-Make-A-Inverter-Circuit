In this project, we are going to teach you making a simple, cheap and powerful inverter circuit. A power inverter is a power electronic device that changes direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC).
	
An inverter converts the DC voltage to an AC voltage. In most cases, the input DC voltage is usually lower while the output AC is equal to the grid supply voltage of either 120 volts, or 240 Volts depending on the country.

There are different types of inverters based on the shape of the switching waveform. These have varying circuit configurations, efficiencies, advantages and disadvantages.

The three commonly used Inverter output stages are, a push-pull with centre tap transformer, push-pull half-bridge, or push-pull full bridge. The push pull with centre tap is most popular due to its simplicity and, guaranteed results; however, it uses a heavier transformer and has a lower efficiency.



Component List - 

1. Transistor -  MJE 13005 *2
2. Resistor – 16 Ω (10 Watt) *2
3. Transformer – 12.0.12 volt (3 Amp)
4. PCBS (Made with JLCPCB)
5. Holder
6. Bulb
7. Power Source – DC 12v


Transistor Pin Out - 

We know that, there are two type of transistor. Every transistor contain 3 legs and this 3 legs have different names. Here we use two different transistor. 

MJE 13005 – MJE 13005 is an NPN transistor and if we count it’s leg from left side, then 1st leg “Base” 2nd leg “Collector” and 3rd leg “Emitter”


Transformer Pin Out - 

To make this project, we are using 12.0.12v and 3 amp transformer. There are two section of a transformer.
That is primary and the other one is secondary. We input AC volt using primary section of this transformer
and connect secondary section with circuit board.


Connect Resistor - 

To make this circuit, first we connect 16 Ω (10 Watt) resistor with the circuit.
We connect one resistor with left side transistor “Base” leg and it’s other terminal with “Collector” leg of right side transistor.

And connect another resistor with “Base” leg of right side transistor and it’s other terminal with “Collector” leg of left side transistor.



Connect Transformer - 

There are three cable at the secondary section of this transformer. If we count it’s leg from left side, then that is T1, T2 and T3.
We connect T1 cable with “Collector” leg of left side transistor and connect T3 cable with “Collector” leg of right side transistor.


Connect Power Source

Now we connect DC 12v positive cable with T2 cable of transformer and connect DC 12v negative cable with Both transistor “Emitter” leg.


Final Step

We just connect ac bulb with holder and connect holder with the circuit. Just plug-in power and make the best use of this circuit.
